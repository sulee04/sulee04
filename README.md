### Hi! I’m Seunguk Lee.

I’m an undergraduate student at KAIST, double-majoring in Industrial Design and Computer Science. If you’d like to learn more about me, visit my website: [sulee.dev](https://sulee.dev).

I’m particularly interested in **web development** and **artificial intelligence** that supports human intelligence.

Most of my source code is not publicly available at the moment, but I’m open to sharing certain projects upon request. Feel free to reach out to me at `sulee04@kaist.ac.kr`.
